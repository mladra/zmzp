# Zwinne WKS
The project was implemented during the classes of Zwinne metodyki zarzÄ…dzania projektami.

## Project description
The goal of the project was to create a system which would allow to create and solve recruitment tests. There were 3 user roles: ADMIN, RECRUITER, CANDIDATE. ADMIN had ability to manage the users (CRUD). RECRUITER could create recruitment test for particular position in the company and check correctness of candidates' answers. CANDIDATE could solve a test for position which he applied to.

## Gained skills and knowledge
During creation of the project I learned:
 - to create REST API,
 - to create user friendly interface with use of the Angular framework and Bootstrap
 - to integrate Spring project with MongoDB database
 - to map documents' fragments to proper objects in dependence of their types (look: `pl.lodz.p.it.wks.wksrecruiter.collections.questions.QuestionInfo`).
